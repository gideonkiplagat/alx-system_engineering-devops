Server: A server is a computer or a software system that provides functionality or services to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can serve various purposes, such as hosting websites, managing resources on a network, storing, and retrieving files, and more.

Role of the Domain Name: A domain name is a human-readable address that serves as an easy-to-remember label for accessing resources on the internet. It provides a way to map easily remembered names to numerical IP addresses associated with computer systems hosting those resources. The role of a domain name is to provide a user-friendly way to access websites or services hosted on servers connected to the internet.

DNS Record for "www.foobar.com": The DNS record for "www.foobar.com" is typically a type of DNS record called a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It points the domain "www.foobar.com" to another domain name, often the main domain or another server hosting the website.

Role of the Web Server: The web server's primary role is to deliver web pages and other content to clients (typically web browsers) upon request. It processes incoming requests for web resources (such as HTML pages, images, CSS files, etc.) and delivers them to the requesting client over HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

Role of the Application Server: The application server hosts and executes applications or software components in a distributed computing environment. It handles the business logic and processes the user requests received from the web server. Application servers often interact with databases and other resources to fulfill client requests.

Role of the Database: The database stores and manages structured data, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. It plays a crucial role in web applications by storing user data, content, configurations, and other essential information required for the application's functionality.

Server Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols over the internet. When a user requests a website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which processes the request and sends back the requested web page along with any associated resources.
